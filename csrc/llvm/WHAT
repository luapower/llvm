LLVM 3.5.0 from http://llvm.org/releases/download.html (UI/NCSA license)


This is only a meta-package: it contains scripts to download, extract 
and build LLVM and Clang.

The reason we're not shipping LLVM binaries is because LLVM is currently 
only needed to build Terra. LLVM doesn't support dynamic linking on Windows
anyway, so it can't be a runtime dependency of anything.
