LLVM 3.5.0 from http://llvm.org/releases/download.html (UI/NCSA license)


This is only a meta-package: it contains scripts to download and extract LLVM.

Because LLVM is currently only used as a build-time dependency for terra,
we're not shipping it as a luapower binary dependency, so we're not keeping
its binaries in luapower's bin directory.
